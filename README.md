# How does the app look like

We're a small team doing great things :) we hope. Anyway, as we're mainly developers, we have no UI/UX colleague. Sketch is our friend. We built this UI (as developers) so you might encounter some difficulties using it. We did not find any inconveniences yet, but we also have no tester. ðŸ˜Ž We only test in production.

# Screens

## Onboarding Screens

We send no data to servers. What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.
